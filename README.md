<p>Getting banned from BattlEye can feel like getting sent straight to gaming purgatory, especially when you’re convinced it’s a big misunderstanding. Fear not!

<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your new BattlEye-secured game banhammer drop the moment you tried logging in with a fresh account? Or does the ban follow you like a bad smell on every new profile? You’ve probably been <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! BattlEye has fingerprinted your PC hardware, making it tricky to play on any new accounts without a workaround.</p>
